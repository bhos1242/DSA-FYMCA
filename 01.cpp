Sparse matrices are highly useful in scenarios where data is sparse—meaning most elements are zero. Below are practical scenarios where sparse matrices shine, particularly in social networks and maps.

1. Social Networks: Adjacency Matrix Representation
Sparse matrices are used to represent connections between users in social networks, where each user (or node) is connected to a small subset of other users.

Example: Friend Connections in a Social Network
Matrix Representation:
Let A[i][j] = 1 if user i is connected to user j, and A[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
For large social networks (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), most users are not connected, so the matrix is mostly zeroes (sparse).
Advantages:
Sparse matrices reduce memory usage by storing only non-zero elements (connections).
Faster algorithms for traversal, such as Graph algorithms (BFS/DFS), when using compressed matrix representations.
C++ Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Represent sparse matrix using a map of maps
class SparseMatrix {
public:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> data;

    void addConnection(int user1, int user2) {
        data[user1][user2] = 1;
        data[user2][user1] = 1;  // Undirected graph
    }

    bool isConnected(int user1, int user2) {
        return data[user1].count(user2) > 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    SparseMatrix network;
    network.addConnection(1, 2);  // User 1 and User 2 are friends
    network.addConnection(2, 3);  // User 2 and User 3 are friends

    cout << "Are User 1 and User 3 connected? ";
    cout << (network.isConnected(1, 3) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
This code uses a sparse matrix implemented as a hash map of hash maps.
Only connected users are stored, reducing memory consumption.
Checking if two users are connected takes constant time

O(1).
2. Maps: Graph Representation of Roads and Locations
Sparse matrices are useful when representing maps and road networks. For a city or country map, most locations are not directly connected by roads, leading to a sparse graph.

Example: Roads Between Cities
Matrix Representation:
A[i][j] stores the distance between city i and city j.
If there is no direct road, A[i][j] = 0.
Scenario: Using a sparse matrix to efficiently represent only the cities connected by roads.
C++ Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Sparse matrix to represent roads as graph
class RoadMap {
public:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, double>> data;

    void addRoad(int city1, int city2, double distance) {
        data[city1][city2] = distance;
        data[city2][city1] = distance;  // Assuming bidirectional roads
    }

    double getDistance(int city1, int city2) {
        if (data[city1].count(city2))
            return data[city1][city2];
        else
            return -1;  // No direct road
    }
};

int main() {
    RoadMap map;
    map.addRoad(1, 2, 10.5);  // Road between city 1 and 2 with distance 10.5
    map.addRoad(2, 3, 5.8);   // Road between city 2 and 3 with distance 5.8

    cout << "Distance between City 1 and City 2: " << map.getDistance(1, 2) << " km" << endl;
    cout << "Distance between City 1 and City 3: " << map.getDistance(1, 3) << " km" << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
This code uses a sparse matrix to store distances between cities.
If there is no direct road, the entry is omitted, saving memory.
The road distances are stored in a map, and access is in constant time

O(1).
Why Sparse Matrix is Preferred:
Memory Efficient: In both social networks and maps, the number of connections/roads is much smaller than the total possible connections.
Faster Algorithms: By storing only non-zero elements, traversal algorithms become more efficient.
Real-World Scalability: Both social networks and map data can grow very large. Sparse matrices ensure scalability.
These are two practical examples of sparse matrices in C++:

Social networks (to store user connections).
Maps (to represent roads between cities).
Both examples show how to store and access sparse data efficiently using hash maps.
