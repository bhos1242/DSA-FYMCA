Explanation:
Struct Member:

Stores PRN, name, academic year, and a pointer to the next member.
Class Club:

head points to the first member, and tail points to the last member.
Supports operations:
addMember(): Adds a new member at the end of the list.
deleteMember(): Deletes a member by PRN.
totalMembers(): Counts the total number of members.
displayMembers(): Displays all members.
concatenate(): Concatenates two club lists.
updateMember(): Updates a memberâ€™s information.
Destructor to free memory at the end.
main() Function:

Demonstrates adding, displaying, concatenating, updating, and deleting members.
